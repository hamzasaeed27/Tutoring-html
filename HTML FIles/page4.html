    <h2 id="h2_programs"> ViBrainium High School After School Programs:</h2>
    <p id="p_1"> ViBrainium believes that education and knowledge does not stop in the classroom. Many
      high school students are already forced to take
      classes that they may not be interested in. Because of this, ViBrainium provides opportunities for students to
      explore and learn other subjects and activities after school
      that they may actually be interested in.
    </p>
    <h3 id="h2_programs"> Robotics: </h3>
    <p class="para"> With a growing economy that has
      a higher demand for STEM fields, it's important that the next generation learns how they can make a difference in
      their world.
      That's why ViBrainium offers a variety of classes and workshops that High Schoolers can enjoy.
      We introduce students to robot design and computer programming using basic machine principles to create robots
      capable of performing simple tasks.
      Robotics camps and classes give students the opportunity to dive deep into the world of robotics and explore how
      computer programming and robot design can solve problems big and small!

    <h4> Culinary Arts: </h4>
    <p class="para"> Culinary/Cookng Classes build
      upon each other to teach students essential kitchen skills, safety, culinary techniques,
      food experimentation, kitchen science, and formulas while tasting a wide variety of foods along the way. This
      program will allow students to tap into their potential in the kitchen and learn a wide variety of food cultures.

    <h4> Martial Arts: </h4>
    <p class="para"> With the event of mixed martial
      arts (MMA) becoming mainstream in the media, more and more people are looking to martial arts and self-defense
      classes as an alternative to the usual gym and fitness routine.
      With ViBrainium's after school Martial Arts program we have been training and teaching martial arts since 2010. We
      proudly bring forth this tradition to new generations of martial artists by offering a variety of classes to our
      students.
